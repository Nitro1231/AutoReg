                                   Writing

        PLEASE BE ADVISED

        Writing courses will have a "B" or "X" restriction starting on
        the first day of instruction. Students will need to contact the
        instructor to obtain an authorization code to add, drop, or
        change the grading option for the class.

        Waitlists for Writing courses will not be activated.

        ADD/DROP Policy during the FIRST and SECOND week of Instruction
        for Composition Courses.

        Students who are permitted to add or drop a Writing Course after
        the first day of instruction must obtain an authorization code
        from the instructor of the section. Students WILL NOT be
        authorized to add a Writing Course after week 1.

        After the second week of the term students will no longer be
        permitted to drop except through petition.

        Students enrolled in Entry-Level and Lower-Division Writing
        courses are REQUIRED TO ATTEND THE ENTIRE FIRST CLASS MEETING.
        Enrolled students who do not show up on the first day WILL BE
        DROPPED from the instructor's roll and their spot will be given
        away. These students will still be required to formally drop the
        course.

        prerequisites, visit the Program website:
